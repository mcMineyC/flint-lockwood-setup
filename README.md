# flint-lockwood-setup
This repo contains all resources used to recreate the Flint Lockwood lab computer setup irl

# Inspiration
This project was originally inspired by the movie "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs".  I've always thought Flint's setup (using old TVs as one gigantic monitor) was insanely cool and the biggest flex, and now that I know a little bit about Linux I'm trying to recreate it.

# Setup
1. Making the fake EDID binary
  First, cd to edid-gen
  Then execute the following command: ```cat modeline | ./modeline2edid```
